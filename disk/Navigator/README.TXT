        Installation Instructions
=======================================================================
* Installation
   Netscape Navigator Gold 3.04 is being distributed as a 32-bit and
   16-bit windows program. 

   To run the 32-bit Navigator, you MUST have a 32-bit TCP/IP stack.
   Both Windows 95 and Windows NT provide 32-bit TCP/IP stacks 
   that you can setup.

   To obtain a copy of Netscape Navigator Gold, first download the 
   self-extracting executable file into a temporary directory.

        16-bit : g16e304.exe
        16-bit : g16e304.exe    (with CoolTalk and Live3D)

   to start the installation.


* For Win95 users, if you are using any versions prior to this
  release, you will get multiple uninstall entries in your
  Add/Remove program.  If you prefer not having multiple 
  entries, you should do an uninstall to remove your previous 
  version of Netscape Navigator Gold before you install the new release.

  file.

=======================================================================
        Running Netscape
=======================================================================
What do I need to run Netscape Navigator Gold?

You must have a direct Internet connection before you can use Netscape.
The ability to send and receive e-mail does not necessarily mean you
can run Netscape. There are three requirements for Netscape Navigator Gold:
    1. A direct Ethernet connection to the net, or a dialup
       SLIP or PPP account from an Internet service provider.
    2. TCP/IP stack
    3. Netscape Navigator Gold software

You can get a direct connection to the Internet through a service
provider in your area.  You will need to get a SLIP or a PPP account
from an Internet provider (for a dialup account).

When you have full Internet connectivity, you need to have a TCP/IP
stack, dialer, and WINSOCK.DLL file.


If you get the error message "Cannot find WINSOCK.DLL" when running
Netscape Navigator Gold, this means your computer is looking for the
WINSOCK.DLL file that is part of a winsock package.
